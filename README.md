## Description
You can test your JavaScript skills with this multiple-choice questions Code-Quiz. In this format, users will be given one question for which they will have three or four options to choose from. Based on the user choice, the score will be incremented. Upon selection of an option, the next question appears automatically. In addition to this, a submit button is introduced, the functionality of which is exactly what their name suggests. after submitting you can go back and start again with the same or the different person. For HTML, I have index.html and HighScores.html, for JavaScript, I have script.js and HighScores.js, for CSS I have styles.css and reset.css. All the questions and answers I put in script.js, for all initials and score, I put in the local storage in HighScores.Js. I use Lato-Google Fonts, a sans serif typeface family by Warsaw-based designer Lukasz Dziedzic, in Polish 'Lato' means 'Summer'. In CSS, I use display: flex; flex-direction: row; and flex wrap: wrap to resize from the bigger screen to the smaller screen. I use a media query to change the color of the screen when resize to max-width: 640 px; and the background color change from white to color: rgb(223, 209, 231).
